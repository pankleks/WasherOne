# WasherOne

DIY Wash, Dry and Cure station for resin prints.
It is designed with:
- 3D printed parts
- Ikea 365+ food container
- Arduino Nano

> All components (excluding printed parts) should cost between 30-40$

## How does it work?

There are 3 buttons (from the left)
- mode (wash, dry, cure)
- time set (pressing increase time of function)
- start/stop

> You should be able to work with ~ 10cm x 10cm (base) up to 15cm height objects.

### Washing

Put Ikea container with the resin part on top of the box. Select wash mode -> set time -> start.
Washing will reverse direction every 30 seconds.

### Drying

Install fan arm. Install plate. Select dry mode -> set time -> start.

### Curing

Install UV LED arm. Install plate. Select cure mode -> set time -> start.

> IMPORTANT: UV LED light is harmful for your eyes. Do not look directly into the UV light. Best use some kind of cover (for example from your resin printer).

## Printed parts

You should print all components on FDM printer.

I used 0.2mm, PLA and no support for all parts except box top cover.

Use brim for larger box parts.

All should fit to 180x180 bed (Prusa Mini)

- Wash top (2 bodies) -> main box and top box cover (top box cover requires supports)
- Wash grid (1 body) -> goes into Ikea container
- Wash rotor (1 body) -> mounted to Wash grid with 608 bearing
- Wash motor plate (2 bodies) -> mounted to the stepper motor + plate for drying and curing
- Wash led arm (2 bodies) -> arm for UV curing LED's + block to secure arm (print 2 times -> it's used also for fan arm)
- Wash fan arm (1 body) -> arm for drying fan

> Tolerances are quite tight -> use included step files to modify if needed.
> All files are in 3MF format - some contains multiple bodies -> print them separately

## Electronics

Control circuit is quite simple. 
Arduino controls: 
- NEMA17 stepper motor via A4988 stepper driver.
- MOSFET power transistor for LED and fan
- Buttons, LED's and digital LED panel

I have designed PCB that you can order from (for example JLCPCB), however circuit is simple enough to assemble it without dedicated PCB.
Schematic and Gerber files are available in `Electronics` folder.

> In new PCB revision, 5V power input pins (as seen in pictures) are exchanged with 4 pairs of VIN/GND pins - their funciton is exacly same (VIN is 5V+). You can use more pins to split power if needed.

## Assembly

I'm sorry but I don't have time to write detailed step by step instruction. However, assembly should be fairly simple, please use photos in `Assembly` folder to guide you.

Essentially:
- Upload code to the Arduino Nano
- Assemble all electronics components on the PCB main board
- Install power socket + on/off switch and RCA plug (you should glue RCA plug into the box as it's fairly loose)
- Install tactile buttons, LED diodes and LED display (you may wish to use glue to secure them)
- Screw in step-down converter (IMPORTANT -> use multimeter to set it for 5V)
- Screw in PCB
- Connect all cables (for all 24V connections use ticker wires)
- Install all magnets in the plates and rotor
  - Magnets for motor plate and dry/cure plate press-fit into holes (you may wish to glue them)
  - Magnets for rotor should be inserted from sides (do not glue them -> washing alcohol will dissolve it anyway)
  - Pay attention so the magnets of motor plate and (rotor/dry-cure plate) attract each other
- NEMA17 motor screws in into box top cover. After installing magnets into motor plate, press-fit it onto motor shaft (should be flat with shaft top)

## Arduino code

Code is available in `Arduino` folder. You should use Platform IO to build and upload it.

https://platformio.org/

All parameters are defined in `Pin.h` file, by default all pins are compatible with PCB I designed.

Code is relatively well commented, see these for more details.

## Fine tunning

Use comments in the code to fine-tune all the parameters such as times, accelerations, and speeds.
The default values work well for me, but may not for you.

> For washing - if you notice skipping rotor (inside container) please regulate distance between motor plate and rotor plate. It may vary depends on your motor shaft length or magnet strength.

> A4988 should be equipped with heat-sink. Motor does not require much power. Use A4988 potentiometer to limit current so it's not overheating.

## Part list

- Arduino Nano
- A4988 stepper driver (one is required, but they may damage easily during testing, so best to equip yourself with 2-3)
- NEMA17 motor
- 2.5 (or 2.1) / 5.5 DC power socket (depending on your PSU)
- 24V PSU (~2-3 Amps) -> brick power supply
- DC On/Off switch
- IRF520 power MOSFET transistor
- 6-8 x PM2E-1LLS (or similar) UV LED (wavelength 390-410nm, 1W)
- LM2596 step-down converter
- 3 x 3mm LED dioses
- 4 digit 7 segment LED display with TM1637 controller
- 100 uF 24V+ electrolytic capacitor
- 1k ohm resistor
- 3 x 220 ohm resistors (for LED's)
- 3 x 150 ohm 5W ceramic resistors (should be connected in parallel)
- 1 x female and 2 x male RCA connectors
- 4 x 25x10x2 neodymium magnets
- 2 x 10x2 (circle) neodymium magnet
- 608 2RS bearing
- 80x80 24V Fan
- Wires

> UV LED resistors resistance should be calculated based on Ohm law depending on LED parameters. Pay attention to proper power capabilities, use multiple in parallel if needed.
